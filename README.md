Here is my pet project.
This is desktop app for converting high-poly 3D models to low-poly one. This involves optimizing object geometry to reduce complexity while preserving visual quality.
Application was implemented with :
OpenGL, GLAD, GLFW  - rendering part   
GLM - linear algebra with calculation
Assimp - 3D model loading with 
DearImGUI - GUI.
